<h1 class="caption1">Music and Art community & online Concert</h1>
<p class="proposal">I collaborated with a real-world client, Black Space Art Fashion, a small startup based in New York that focuses on art, classical music, and education. My work included redesigning their webpage and participating in the initial stages of creating a new app, where I helped determine its target audience, basic functions, and interface. Additionally, I created promotional flyers.</p>

<p class="proposal"> The app's primary purpose is to establish a platform and community exclusively for artists to communicate with each other. Whether they are new or experienced artists, they can upload their work here and access various opportunities. The app can also be used to host online concerts, liberating classical performances from the constraints of physical venues.</p>
