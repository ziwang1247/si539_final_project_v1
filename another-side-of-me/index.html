<h1 class="caption1">The Distinction and Connection Between Two Identities</h1>
<p class="proposal">In today's interconnected world, more and more of our daily communication and social interactions occur online rather than in-person. This shift towards virtual communication has created a new landscape in which we can explore and express ourselves in unique ways. With the rise of social media and gaming, individuals are finding a sense of liberation and escapism in virtual worlds. It is an environment in which one can let go of the constraints and pressures of everyday life and truly let their imaginations run wild.</p>
<h2 class="caption2">Community is here</h2>
<p class="proposal">This is where the idea of creating Another Side of Me, a community for digital identities. By building a VR space and mobile app, I want to provide a safe space for people to explore and celebrate their virtual selves, ultimately bridging the gap between the two worlds and help people feel more grounded and connected. Through fostering a community of individuals who share similar interests and passions, we can help people build a sense of belonging and identity in the virtual world. Ultimately, this can lead to a more inclusive and accepting society, one that recognizes and values the diversity of digital identities.</p>
